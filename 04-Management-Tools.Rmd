# Data Management Tools
Thus far, the data management tools we've come across have largely been developed by [Local Contexts](https://localcontexts.org/labels/biocultural-labels/). If you have examples of other practical tools or organizations that develop them, please share!

## Biocultural Labels
Data labels are text elements that describe individual data points. They are used on metadata as a tag that can be easily categorized and searched. Biocultural (BC) labels are data-markers being piloted by the [The Biocultural Label Initiative](https://www.enrich-hub.org/bc-labels) to help define community expectations and consent about research data use. "The BC Labels provide a practical application of Indigenous data sovereignty principles to issues of access and benefit-sharing for genetic resources and support Nagoya Protocol expectations around the disclosure and origins of Indigenous data used in research contexts." (Anderson & Hudson 2021)
